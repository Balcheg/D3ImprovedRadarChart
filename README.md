Interactive Radar Chart
===================
Developed by Brian Booden & Matthieu Burel, based on D3.js

Update 05/10/2016
=================

- Added support for 10k points, previously was limited to 50
- Simplified Dimensions by adding 2 mandatory, instead of 1 mandatory and 1 optional, which was confusing
- Reworked, simpler color schemes
- Tweaks to label sizes, radar positioning and margins, and legend spacing, to make best use of space

Please try the new version, and leave feedback, as we endeavour to improve our extension!

Regards,
Brian and Matt
